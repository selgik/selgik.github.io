### Project#1: Streamline the process
* Problem: I want to feed the data and see the results in real-time. However, I do not want to use two platform separately for entering data and visualizaing data (ex. excel to Tableau). 
* Solution: Use excel Macro/VBA to automate the process of data entry with visualization.

### Project#2: Navigate through dashboard (Covid-19 data)
* Problem: I want to review various data related to Covid-19 (ex. case overview, change over time, worldwide status etc.) using filter.
* Solution: Make a Tableau dashboard (one page)
* Reference: [GitHub Ref2](https://github.com/selgik/Data-visualization)

### Project#3: Navigate through dashboard (Service request data)
* Problem: I want to review service requests status over the time, per agency and type. Having too much information in one page dashboard would be overwhelming. 
* Solution: Make a Tableau dashboard (multiple page)
