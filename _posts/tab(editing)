## SQL Code Review 
### Understand the Dataset 
Question 1: Get summary of data

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT unique_key, 
    created_date,
    closed_date,
    agency,
    agency_name,
    complaint_type,
    location_type,
    incident_address,
    address_type,
    city,
    status,
    resolution_description
FROM bigquery-public-data.new_york_311.311_service_requests
LIMIT 10 
```

-- Question 2: Check completeness of data
-- Finding: There are 2283 cases where status is "Closed" but no closed_date is provided.
SELECT closed_date, status
FROM bigquery-public-data.new_york_311.311_service_requests
WHERE status = "Closed" 
  AND closed_date IS NULL


-- Question 3: How many status type are there? 
-- Finding: There are 13 types. Status types to be considered when visualiziaing dataset are: Cancel/Cancelled, Closed, Rest.
SELECT DISTINCT status
FROM bigquery-public-data.new_york_311.311_service_requests


-- Question 4: What is the percentage of each status?
-- Finding: Around 96% of cases are closed. 
WITH temp AS (
    SELECT 
        status, 
        COUNT(status) AS counts,
        (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bigquery-public-data.new_york_311.311_service_requests) AS total_counts
    FROM 
        bigquery-public-data.new_york_311.311_service_requests
    GROUP BY
        status
    )

SELECT 
    status,
    ROUND ((counts/total_counts)*100,2) AS percentage_total
FROM
    temp
ORDER BY 
    percentage_total DESC


-- Question 5: Ensure that all cases are assigned with its status
-- Finding: no null value found under status column.
SELECT status 
FROM bigquery-public-data.new_york_311.311_service_requests
WHERE status IS NULL


-- Question 6: What are the top complaints? 
-- Finding: Noise-residential > heat/hot water > illegal parking
SELECT complaint_type, COUNT(complaint_type) AS counts
FROM bigquery-public-data.new_york_311.311_service_requests

-- Question 7: Who are the top agency handling the requests?
-- Finding: New York City Police Department > Department of Housing Preservation and Development > Department of Transportation
SELECT agency_name, COUNT(agency_name) AS counts

-- Question 8: Which year did the requests hit the most number?
-- Finding: 2018 > 2020 > 2017
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(year FROM created_date) AS year,
    COUNT(*) AS counts
FROM bigquery-public-data.new_york_311.311_service_requests
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY counts desc


-- Question 9: Calculate average time required for request to be closed. Verify results.
-- Finding: Results between Tableau and BigQuery are similar except for HPD. (Why huge difference for HPD?)
-- (1) Calculated field from Tableau
DATEDIFF('day',[Created Date],[Closed Date])

-- (2) Verification in BigQuery
